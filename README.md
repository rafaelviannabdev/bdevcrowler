for this project I created in django 2 views, the first one will show how to scrap with BeautifulSoup4,
this method we have to find the elementes in the html of the page. the second mathod is finding the 
requested site's api and calling them directly. 
To access the results just run the django project:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver

then you can see the first result with the url http://localhost:8000/api/1/dogs
or the second result with http://localhost:8000/api/2/dogs

you can also change 'dogs' for any search you would like to save.
